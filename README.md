# BIOMeLab - The Bad Idea-O-Matic Ecosystem

**A virtual deep-sea dive into my art, coding oddities, and lightweight multimedia.**

Welcome to **BIOMe**, the official archive of my creative experiments—where fishoids swim alongside AI-crafted single-file HTML toolkits, low-bandwidth media thrives, and the Bad Idea-O-Matic churns out innovation at its finest (or weirdest). 

## 🌊 What You'll Find Here

🔹 **AI-Crafted Single-File HTML Tools** – Tiny, standalone utilities that run directly in your browser.
🔹 **Lo-Fi Multimedia** – Compressed, low-bandwidth-friendly media for maximum accessibility.
🔹 **Art & Experiments** – Digital, generative, and conceptual works from the depths of the BIOMe.
🔹 **Fishoid Content** – The one and only hub for aquatic anthropomorphic oddities.
